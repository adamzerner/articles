If you've been been doing HTML/CSS/JS for a few weeks, you've probably run into 
problems with Internet Explorer. Meaning, the code works for all the other browsers
except for IE. You ask yourself, "why?!!!". And then you have to look up some work 
around. Here's why.

So, early on in the days of internet browsers, IE had a great majority of the market 
share. Meaning that somewhere around 80% (rough number, I made it up) of people used IE as their internet browser. They had a monopoly and wanted to keep it.

IE chose to use different conventions from all the other browsers. That 
way, developers would have to choose between:
1) Being IE compatible.
2) Being compatible with other browsers.
3) Spending a ton of time making sure that you're compatible with IE and the other 
browsers.

IE was hoping that developers would choose 1). They thought, "Since we have so much 
of the market, they won't choose 2). And we'll make it really time consuming for them
to choose 3), that way they'll choose 1). And once developers develop for IE and not 
other browsers, sites won't work on other browsers, and people will use IE."

Assholes.

Is the marginal revenue they're generating really worth the cost to humanity? To 
holding back the internet?

Fortunately, people started using other browsers, IE lost their monopoly, and had to 
start being compliant. The past few releases of IE are pretty compliant, so 
fortunately it's not something developers have to think about too much anymore. 
Although, a lot of old people and slow-moving corporations/bureaucracies still use 
old versions of IE. And so, developers are still trying to make sure their sites are 
IE < 8 compatible. Which is unfortunate because these developers could be doing other
more productive things with their time.
