What is NodeJS? It's a JavaScript interpreter. That's really it.

Have you ever used any other languages? Perhaps Java or Ruby or something?
To run code in Ruby, first you had to install Ruby, and then you have to go to your
command line and run a command like this:

ruby example.rb

The reason why you could do this is because you installed Ruby. Otherwise, you wouldn't
be able to do this.

How do you run JavaScript code? You can't do it from your command line. For example, 
you can't run a command analogous to ruby example.rb. You can't run

javascript example.js

So how do you run JavaScript code? Well... there's a few options:
1) You could make an HTML file, go to it in your browser, and then open the browser 
console (cmd+j with Chrome) and you'll see your code run.
2) Or you could just go to any web page, open the browser console (cmd+j) and type 
and run the code.
3) Or you could go to a site like repl.it or jsbin.com to type and run your code there.

To run JavaScript code, you need an interpreter. In 1) and 2) your browser is the 
interpreter (yes, browsers can interpret JS). In 3) those sites wrote their own JS 
interpreters.

You'll notice that this is pretty different from other languages. In other languages
you probably had to install them on your computer and run commands like ruby example.rb.

When you download ruby, your installing a *ruby interpreter* on your computer that 
runs the code in example.rb when you run ruby example.rb in your command line. 
NodeJS is a *javascript interpreter*. When you install it, you could run 

node example.js

and it'll run the code in example.js. That's essentially all NodeJS is :)

=====================================================================================
But you probably still have more questions. "Doesn't NodeJS have to do with servers 
or something?"

Yes. Let me explain.

A server could really mean two different things. The way I always understood the term, 
it means a physical computer. When I type in google.com, it makes a request to a 
physical computer that Google owns, that sends back a response to my computer that my 
browser interprets and displays for me. In this case, a server is a physical computer.

But a server can also refer to a program. On that physical server, a software program 
is running that takes requests and sends responses. So in this sense, a server is 
software.

And this software doesn't have to be on a different computer from the client. I could 
have a server program running on my computer. I could send requests to it, and it'll
send back responses.

====================================================================================
Ok, back to Node.

So now that we know that servers could mean a software program, a sensible question is,
"What language is this program written in?". Before Node, the only real JavaScript 
interpreter was the browser. So, server programs couldn't be written in JavaScript. Now
that Node has been invented, these server programs could run JavaScript, and you could 
handle server-side stuff with JavaScript!

And this is usually what people mean when they're talking about Node. They're usually 
referring to Node allowing you to run JavaScript code on the server and use it for 
server-side programming.
