I'm reading this book right now. Pages 45-50 are all referencing
the same diagram. But the diagram is only on page 51. So every time
I want to reference it, I have to turn to page 51.

It would be much better if each page had the diagram on the top half
of the page, and the text on the bottom half. The text would have to 
take up 10 pages instead of 5 though. And we'd have to print the image
on each of these 10 pages, which would take up a lot of ink.

What if we didn't have to print the same picture 10 times though. Can 
you think of a way to do that?

I'll tell you the way I thought of. You'd just have one page with the 
image on the top half of the page, and a 10 page mini flip book on the
bottom of this page. The flip book would contain the text.

This would accomplish two things:
1) Let you reference the picture while you're reading the text
(instead of having to reference it on page 51).
2) Prevent you from having to print the image 10 times.

In programming, there's an idea of Don't Repeat Yourself. They say to 
keep your code DRY.

Lets think of a web example that is analogous to the book example. Say
you have 10 web pages with the same picture on the top half. The first 
thing that would come to my mind is to just have 10 view files with the
same <img> tag, and different content underneath the <img>.

But this is repetitive. How can we avoid this repetition? By using partials.

You'd have one view file
