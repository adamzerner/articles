To understand what data structures are, let's first review the 6 
types in JavaScript.

Primitive Types:
1) Number
2) String
3) Boolean
4) Null
5) Undefined

Reference Type:
1) Object


Now, you probably have some sort of vague understanding that an 
array is a data structure, along with things like linked lists
and queues.

But what about a Number? Is that a data structure? And what 
about a String? Is that a data structure?

The answer to both of those questions is: "no".

But why? Why is an array a data structure but a Number isn't? 
Well, an Array could store multiple elements in it while a 
Number... is just a Number. A Number doesn't *store* anything, 
it *is* something (if that makes sense). A data structure lets 
you *store* data.

==============================================================
- Ok, so I could understand that an Array and an Object are both 
data structures because they store things. And I understand why 
primitive types aren't data structures. But I hear all this talk 
about *building* your own data structures. I have no clue how to 
do that. From what I could tell, languages come with data 
structures and you use them. How is it possible to build your own?

Great question. So let's think about what a data structure is. 
All it is is something that can allows you to get and set data.

In fact, you're more familiar with this than you think. You've 
done classes before right? Watch this:

function Person(name) {
	this.name = name;
	this.getName = function() {
		return this.name;
	}
	this.setName = function(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
var p = new Person("Adam");
p.getName() => "Adam"
p.setName("Ross");
p.getName() => "Ross"

The Person class is used to get and set data, which is all a data
structure is. In this case, it can only get and set one property:
name. Usually we'd want our data structure to be able to store 
many properties, but this Person class is still a data structure.

=================================================================
Let's try building a better data structure:

function Queue() {
	this.data = [];
	this.enqueue = function(el) {
		
	}
	this.dequeue = function(el) {

	}
}
