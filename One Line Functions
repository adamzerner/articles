Are one-line functions good, or bad?

function sayHello() {
	console.log('hello');
}

sayHello(); vs. console.log('hello');

Which is better?

Let's start by asking the question of what your goal is in 
writing code. Off the top of my head, I can think of two:
1. Accomplishing something
2. Making it readable

sayHello() and console.log('hello'); both accomplish the 
same exact thing. So the question really is 2 - which is 
more readable.

When you see sayHello(), you have to remember what the output
is. When you see console.log('hello'), you have to interpret
it and figure out what the output is.


Let me give another example:

function complex() {
	djlfsdlfjdssljkfjsdlfjs
}

complex() vs. djlfsdlfjdssljkfjsdlfjs

When you see djlfsdlfjdssljkfjsdlfjs, you have to interpret
it and figure out what the output is. When you see complex(), 
you just have to remember what the output is, which will probably
be easier.

So the question really is, "What's easier: remembering what 
the abstracted function's output is, or interpreting the code
and figuring out what the output is?"

The answers to this question will determine when it's best
to abstract (in cases where 1. is being held constant).
