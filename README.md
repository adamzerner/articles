Technical articles I write as I proceed through Fullstack Academy.

1) The style is very socratic (back and forth questions and answers between a hypothetical student and teacher). I really like this style. I think it's capable of illustrating things that are really difficult to explain lecture-style. It surprises me that more educational resources don't at least use the socratic method once in a while.

2) To anyone who doesn't know what Fullstack Academy is, it's a coding bootcamp, and I am a *student*. These explanations are NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT at all. They reflects my understanding, and I am no expert.

3) There's a few things I'm uncertain about. I tab in 3 or 4 times, and ask the question after writing //. If you're a Fullstack instructor (or if you happen to know the answer), please help!

4) I am using GitHub for this rather than a blog or something because it allows me to use txt files, which allows me to reference things by line number, which turns out to be really useful. If people actually find this useful, maybe I'll spruce it up a bit and make a blog.

I hope someone finds these useful!
