Technical articles I write as I proceed through Fullstack Academy.

1) The style is very socratic (back and forth questions and answers between a hypothetical student and teacher). I really like this style. I think it's capable of illustrating things that are really difficult to explain lecture-style. It surprises me that more educational resources don't at least use the socratic method once in a while.

2) To anyone who doesn't know what Fullstack Academy is, it's a coding bootcamp, and I am a *student*. These explanations are NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT at all. They reflects my understanding, and I am no expert.

I hope someone finds these useful!
